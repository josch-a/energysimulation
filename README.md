# energysimulation
A software project to collect and improve models, simulation and optimization algorithms for energy, water and other supply systems. An open-source modeling tool for the simulation and optimization of renewable nano/micro-off-grid supply system is developed. Datasheet-based system component models consider dynamic and high-resolution influencing factors. The practical application of the modeling tool is presented through a multi-objective optimization based on the Non-Sorting-Genetic-Algorithm-II with the objectives of minimal costs and load outage.
